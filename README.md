## Introduction 

The On-Demand Home Repair Service Android application is an application that people
can use to find service providers for work in their homes, such as appliance repair, window
cleaning, furniture assembly and so on. Homeowners can request professional services using
the app in a matter of seconds. Got an electrical problem at home, hire an electrician near you
who will fix it in no time. All that needs to be done by the homeowner is to create an account,
search the service by its name, time or rating, and select which service provider they want. In
addition, homeowner can then rate the service and leave a comment. This just makes things
easier for people.

This application also allows the administrator to login his/her account and add new
services at anytime. On top of that, the service provider can register an account and add the
services added by admin as his/her provided services. Also, the service provider can add or
modify his/her available times at anytime.
